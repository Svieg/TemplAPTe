# TemplAPTe : Hide your ass while chasing the bad APTs !

## Desription

TemplAPTe is a tool to quickly create VM templates with user profiles while hiding *trying* to hide most of the VM artifacts. Why ? Simple : Because a vanilla XP VM is not an interesting target. This project is helped by the 2015-2016 UPIR program at Polytechnique Montréal with the supervision of Professor José Fernandez.
